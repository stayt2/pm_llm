# S&P-Analyzer

## Overview

A Password Manager (PM) is a tool that helps users manage their credentials, such as username-password pairs. It is highly recommended by security experts and major standards bodies. Consequently, the adoption rate of PMs is increasing annually. However, since PMs handle sensitive information, users have raised concerns about security and privacy.

To address these concerns, we introduce an open-source large language model (LLM) designed to analyze user attitudes towards these issues.

## Features

- **User Sentiment Analysis**: Detect and analyze user concerns related to privacy and security.
- **Automated Feedback Generation**: Facilitate the creation of feedback tickets based on user sentiment.
- **Open-Source**: Fully accessible for community collaboration and improvement.

## Installation

To install and set up the LLM, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XXX/pm_llm.git
cd pm_llm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the model for analyzing user feedback:

```bash
python analyze_feedback.py --input your_feedback_data.txt
```
